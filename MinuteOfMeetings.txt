Meeting 1 (18/10/22)
- Initial dicussion around the specifics of the project
- We decided that an entire game engine would not be possible within the scope of the project, so instead the project will focus on 2D Rendering
- Discussed using OpenGL for rendering
- Aim for next meeting is to research OpenGL and graphics programming

Meeting 2 (1/11/22)
- Looked at the inital chess demo I created in OpenGL and how I had abstracted the OpenGL core concept such as vertex and index buffers into classes
- Discussed scene graphs and project architecture
- Aim for next meeting is to finialise project plan

Meeting 3 (14/11/22)
- Looked over and discussed project setup and inital 2D renderer design
- Discussed types of scene graphs, decided that a quad tree would be the best approach for what I'm aiming towards
- Aim for next meeting is to look into quad trees, unit testing and orthographic cameras

Meeting 4 (29/11/22)
- Looked over my progress on the orthographic camera and entity transforms
- Discussed approach to testing in a bit more detail, decided that both unit testing and screenshot testing would be required
- Aim for next meeting is to look into the types of testing and create a plan for how I'm going to implement the QuadTree so we can discuss it before the Christmas break

Meeting 5 (13/12/22)
- Discussed the January demo and what I would be creating for it
- Showed off my initial mockup of the the quadtree in a header file
- Decided that a demo showing off a working quadtree with the different nodes being rendered would work best
- Moving entitys would show that entity updating is working correctly
- Aim for the next time we meet will be to create a demo for the January demo
